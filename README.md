# metrocar-project

**Project Background:**

This project focuses on analyzing Metrocar's customer funnel to identify areas for improvement and optimization. Metrocar, a ride-sharing app similar to Uber and Lyft, connects riders with drivers through a user-friendly mobile platform. By examining various stages of the customer journey, we aim to provide actionable insights and recommendations to enhance the overall user experience and increase conversion rates.

**About Metrocar:**

Metrocar's business model is based on a platform that connects riders with drivers through a mobile application. Metrocar acts as an intermediary between riders and drivers, providing a user-friendly platform to connect them and facilitate the ride-hailing process.

**Objective:**

To analyze the customer funnel and address key business questions by using SQL for data collection and Pandas for further analysis and visualization. Optional analysis: track the user journey from ride request to ride review, building a base table and funnel aggregation logic to gain deeper insights.

**Approach:**

Collect and explore data using SQL to ensure counts decrease through each funnel step. Clean and manipulate the data with Python and Pandas for consistency. Analyze drop-offs between steps and visualize them with percent-of-top and percent-of-previous methods. Finally, evaluate platform performance, age group dynamics, and surge pricing strategies to provide data-driven recommendations.

**Business Questions:**

- Which steps of the funnel need research and improvement? Are there specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?
- Based on platform (iOS, Android, Web), where should we focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year?
- Which age groups perform best at each funnel stage, and which likely contain our target customers?
- If we adopt a surge pricing strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?
- Which part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate, and how can we improve it?

Tools: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, Dash), Google Colab, and SQL (Postgresql).

This project is a team effort consisting of 4 people (Jul 22 - Aug 2, 2024).
